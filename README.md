## Naive bayes :
- It is **generative algorithm** , i.e.,which basically focuses on likelihood probability and encourages to find the probability distribution of given data
- It assumes that the features are all **Independent** from each other and **Identical** to each other (basically same type of distribution).
- Does not require to use gradient descent or other type of optimisation algorithm.
- Require less amount of data.
- It is quite simple and robust

## Logistic Regression: 
- It is **discirminative algorithm**,i.e., it focuses more on the posterior probability and does not care much about the probability distribution of the data.
- It performs function approximation by using sigmoid function.
- It does require optimisation algorithm to get the parameter highly optmised.
- Require greater amount of data for training.
